- Uses a unified approach to combine the steps of localization, segmentation,
  and recognition

- Recognizes multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs using
  Street View House Numbers dataset

- Uses a CNN to work directly on pixel values

- The Street View House Numbers dataset contains images with each number
  boxed off. The approach in this paper will recognize them all at once
  rather than separating and cropping each numerical instance.

- Approach: find the rectangular bounding box, expand the bounding box by 30%
  in either direction, and resize to 64x64. This creates several variations of
  the same image.

- Best architecture consists of eight convolutional hidden layers, one locally
  connected hidden layer, and two densely connected hidden layers

- All connections are feedforward and go from one
  layer to the next (no skip connections)

- Significant accuracy gains up to 9 layers for the neural network structure

- Caveat, this approach assumes a character length of at most 5 (bounded
  length). Does not scale with greater character lengths, only less.
