Test with one other font type and list accuracy/loss metrics

Test with black and white images

Test with images which have added perturbations

Possibility: Create labelled CAPTCHAs, then create a GAN to produce more
CAPTCHAs for a training set, and use that data to train a model

Another possibility: Creating a mixed neural network for solving variations of
CAPTCHA images https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08419.pdf
